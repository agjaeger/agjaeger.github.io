<p>Carolina Cruz-Neira, Daniel J. Sandin, and Thomas A. DeFanti. 1993. Surround-screen projection-based virtual reality: the design and implementation of the CAVE. In Proceedings of the 20th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques (SIGGRAPH '93). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 135-142</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This paper describes the CAVE system in detail and demonstrates that projection technology applied to virtual-reality goals can produce a system that matches the quality of existing devices.</p>
<p>The projection system is setup around the idea of approximating a dome (sphere) with a cube. This CAVE uses frame-sequential stereo and green phosphor cathoray tubes with a total resolution of 1024x1024 and a total refresh rate of 60Hz.</p>
<p>To minimize shadows, this CAVE is rear-projected. </p>
<p>The paper outlines some shortcomings with this version of the CAVE</p>
<ol>
<li>Cost </li>
<li>Ability to Project On All Six Sides</li>
<li>Light Spillage</li>
<li>Fragility</li>
<li>New Control Paradigms</li>
<li>Directional Sound</li>
<li>Ability to Document with Cameras</li>
</ol>
<p>This paper concludes that this device achieves a virtual environment that is multi-user and is comparable to HMDs. This device has already shown the potential in a wide range of fields.</p>
<p>Lastly, this paper outlines the use of super computers and usage in high traffic environments such as museums and schools as future work.</p>
