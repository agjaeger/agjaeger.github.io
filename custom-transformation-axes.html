<p>Daniel Mendes, Maur√≠cio Sousa, Rodrigo Lorena, Alfredo Ferreira, and Joaquim Jorge. 2017. Using custom transformation axes for mid-air manipulation of 3D virtual objects. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST '17). ACM, New York, NY, USA, Article 27, 8 pages.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This paper outlines a user study regarding several methods of positioning virtual objects using a Vive including the defacto 6DOF method, a method using virtual widgets to represent local coordinate axes, and lastly their novel solution which uses a gesture based system to restrict movement.</p>
<p>The researchers hosted a user study of 24 users who were told to perform several tasks related to manipulating virtual objects.</p>
<p>They conclude that directly manipulating a 3D object with 6DOF is inprecise by nature. Also, they note that while DOF separation (common in traditional computer systems) increases performance, the time to learn increases.</p>
<p>Their novel approach (using gestures) was found to perform worse than the widgets approach. </p>
<p>As future work, the researchers note that their research contradicts previous work regarding DOF separation. </p>
