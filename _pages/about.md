### Who Am I On The Inside?
When I am not at work, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, playing 
video games and doing small projects for my portfolio. The current games 
I play are Overwatch and Runescape.

I am curious, I like thinking about tough problems and finding a 
solution that is refined, and appropriate.

### Current Employment
I am currently employed as a Graduate Assistant for the University of 
Arkansas's [Emerging Analytics Center](http://eac-ualr.org). I have 
two mentors [Dr. Carolina Cruz-Neira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Cruz-Neira) 
and [Dr. Dirk Reiners](http://www.dirkreiners.com/). I am currently 
working on two projects: CAVE in a Box and for the
[DoE Seeds](https://seedscenter.uark.edu/). 

Outside of my official projects, I enjoy spending time working on learning 
Computer Graphics via OpenGL and Virtual Reality Devices such as the 
Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.
