Finally after much ado, I am moving Gotchacode to Octopress. There are various reasons for doing it.
I am listing some of them here:

- There is absolutely no good theme if you are running a technical blog.
- Syntax highlighting is pathetic.
- I can't write post in my text editor.
- There is no source control.

But I will miss blogspot too. The integrated analytics was best in class and so was the SEO.
