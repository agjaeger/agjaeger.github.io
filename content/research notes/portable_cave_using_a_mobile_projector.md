## Notes

This demo showcases the use of projector phones to simulate a CAVE.

This version of a CAVE is low-cost, allows a group to view a visualiztion, and portable at the cost of immersion.

Essentially, the researchers use the projector as a 'spotlight' into the virtual world. 

It would be interesting to extend this demo to include two projectors on the head (to produce stereo) and in the SDK include software to do dynamic edge blending if two people are looking in the same direction.
