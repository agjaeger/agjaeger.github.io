## Notes

Explores the relationship between the virtual arm representations in respect to senses of agency of ownership.

In the experiment of 24 participants, each participant wore a vive and interacted with spheres contained in a box using a kinect. The spheres are initially grey but would turn blue to indicate the user was to touch it.

The experiment used three different arm representations

1. Hand-Only
2. Hand + Forearm
3. Whole Arm

The researchers concluded that parcipants were completeing the tasks faster and more accurately using Hand-Only and Hand+Forearm. There were no significant differences between these methods. However there was some signifcant differences betweent Hand+Forearm and the Whole Arm.

The paper outlines that the kinect was not the best device for tracking as it lost tracking several times throughout the experiment. Also, the participants learned the experiement progressively, so latter tasks were faster and more accurate than the first task.

Lastly, the paper outlines some future work regarding virtual legs and the impact of different virtual arm representations on interaction tasks such as grasping, writing, and gestures.
