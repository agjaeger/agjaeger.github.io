## Notes

This paper outlines a user study regarding several methods of positioning virtual objects using a Vive including the defacto 6DOF method, a method using virtual widgets to represent local coordinate axes, and lastly their novel solution which uses a gesture based system to restrict movement.

The researchers hosted a user study of 24 users who were told to perform several tasks related to manipulating virtual objects.

They conclude that directly manipulating a 3D object with 6DOF is inprecise by nature. Also, they note that while DOF separation (common in traditional computer systems) increases performance, the time to learn increases.

Their novel approach (using gestures) was found to perform worse than the widgets approach. 

As future work, the researchers note that their research contradicts previous work regarding DOF separation.
