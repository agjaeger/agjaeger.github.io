## Notes

This paper describes the CAVE system in detail and demonstrates that projection technology applied to virtual-reality goals can produce a system that matches the quality of existing devices.

The projection system is setup around the idea of approximating a dome (sphere) with a cube. This CAVE uses frame-sequential stereo and green phosphor cathoray tubes with a total resolution of 1024x1024 and a total refresh rate of 60Hz.

To minimize shadows, this CAVE is rear-projected. 

The paper outlines some shortcomings with this version of the CAVE

1. Cost 
2. Ability to Project On All Six Sides
3. Light Spillage
4. Fragility
5. New Control Paradigms
6. Directional Sound
7. Ability to Document with Cameras

This paper concludes that this device achieves a virtual environment that is multi-user and is comparable to HMDs. This device has already shown the potential in a wide range of fields.

Lastly, this paper outlines the use of super computers and usage in high traffic environments such as museums and schools as future work.
