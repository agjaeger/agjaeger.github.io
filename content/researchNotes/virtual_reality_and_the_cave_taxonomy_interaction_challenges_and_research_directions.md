## Notes

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current status of VR Systems (the CAVE in particular) and tries to address the interaction challenges as well as research directions when building an app for the CAVE.

The paper starts off with a defintion of key elements in a virtual reality experience

1. A Virtual World
2. Immersion
3. Feedback
4. Interactivity
5. Participants

They describe a taxonomy for Virtual Reality Systems

* Virtual Reality
  * Basic
    * Hand Based
    * Monitor Based
  * Enhanced  
    * Partially Immersed
      * Wall Projectors
      * ImmersaDesk
      * Monocular Head Based
    * Fully Immersed
      * Room Based
        * Vehicle Simulation
        * CAVE
      * Binocular Head Based

The researchers describes the CAVE as one of the most important virtual reality devices
