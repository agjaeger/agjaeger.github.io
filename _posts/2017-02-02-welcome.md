Hello world! 

This is a place for me to share my thoughts, projects, 
and life to everyone. If you are reading this, I am honored for 
taking some time out of your life. If you have read something and 
wish to contact me about it, please send me an email, I will be 
happy to discuss it with you!

This is primarily intended to be a technical blog focusing on 
computer graphics, however more than likely it will turn out to 
be a lifestyle blog that follows my life.

We will see.
