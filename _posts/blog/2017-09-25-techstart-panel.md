Panelist for the 2017 TechStart Campaign to better Computer Science Education in 
Arkansas

{% include iframe  iframePath='/slides/2017/09/25/techstart-panel.html' %}

Earlier today, I was proud to serve as a panelist for the Facebook TechStart campaign 
to increase computer science education in Arkansas. In the pictures, I am on the far left, 
next to Peipei Zhou (Director of Facebook TechStart). I answered questions and provided 
guidance to young Arkansas high schoolers as they prepare to learn computer science.

Computer science education has always been incredibly low in Arkansas. Before I attended 
the Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts (ASMSA) the only education I was provided 
was typing, Mircosoft Office, and EAST (an A/V class based around learning Adobe products). 
Facebook TechStart is donating 600 Oculus Rifts to Arkansas schools AND we are the first ones to 
have this honor. Govenor Hutchinson also passed several laws requiring computer science (coding)
courses in every Arkansas school and this is done before several states (including New York and California)
passed laws that are similar.

As you guys know, I like to be brief. More information can be found 
at the links below.
