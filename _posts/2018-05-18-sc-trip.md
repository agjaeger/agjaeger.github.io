Quick update on my life.

I got an internship for Intel this summer in Santa Clara, California, I 
will be writing a raytracer using their new programming language C for Media.
I am super excited to be working underneath Dr. Yuting Yang and his team.

To get to Santa Clara, I decided to drive directly from my parent's house in 
Leslie all the way there.

This is the route I took. Overall it took 3 days to drive, however I could have 
done it in two. Each of the destinations in the route was where I stopped for the night.

Overall, it was a fairly monotonmous trip where I lived off of fast food and drove 
until I felt like dying. However, driving through the mesas and the mountains in 
outside of Albuquerque and the moutains on Interstate 5 were amazing.
