My name is Alex Jaeger and I suck at introductions. I am just a nerd that 
was interested in video games as a kid and that grew into learning more 
about computer graphics.

Im still in college right now, so I am trying to find time in between classes 
and working to explore my interests. I like to watch movies, experience new things, 
and figure out what Im doing in life. 

With any hope, I wish to work for a national lab doing research into 
virtual/augmented reality or computer graphics in general.

This website is to help me keep track of my life and lessons learned as I 
progress through my career.

If you have any thoughts (good or bad), please drop me a line at 
agjaeger@ualr.edu. I would appreciate it :)
